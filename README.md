# reminder
This is a small project that can send an email to alert you when a program running on a remote server crashes.  
This project uses QQmail as an example, you need to apply for SMTP service before using it.  
Just use it by putting `sendmail.py` file under your code directory and add `from sendmail import sendmail` in the beginning then use it like `example.py` shows.
